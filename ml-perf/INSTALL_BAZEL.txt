(1) Download bazel-<version>-dist.zip from GitHub, for example bazel-0.18.0-dist.zip
https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases

(2) Unpack the zip file somewhere on disk.

(3) Install prerequisites:
sudo apt-get install build-essential openjdk-8-jdk python zip unzip

(4) Open a shell or Terminal window.

(5) cd to the directory where you unpacked the distribution archive.

(6) Run the compilation script: bash ./compile.sh.

The compiled output is placed into output/bazel. This is a self-contained Bazel
binary, without an embedded JDK. You can copy it anywhere or use it in-place.
For convenience we recommend copying this binary to a directory thatâ€™s on your
PATH (such as /usr/local/bin on Linux).
